# edrv-adxl345

Rust driver for ADXL345.

## Overview

This project provides a Rust driver for the ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer. It aims to offer a consistent and reliable interface for interacting with the ADXL345 sensor in embedded Rust applications.

## Maintenance

This project is maintained by the embedded-drivers team. Our organization's goal is to provide consistent driver access interfaces for embedded Rust and to maintain these drivers collectively to avoid orphaned crates.

## Features
