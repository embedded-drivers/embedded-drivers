# edrv-bmp180

Rust driver for BMP180 and BMP085.

## Overview

This project provides a Rust driver for the BMP180 and BMP085 temperature and pressure sensors. It aims to offer a consistent and reliable interface for interacting with the BMP180 and BMP085 sensors in embedded Rust applications.

## Maintenance

This project is maintained by the embedded-drivers team. Our organization's goal is to provide consistent driver access interfaces for embedded Rust and to maintain these drivers collectively to avoid orphaned crates.

## Features

- Read temperature and pressure data from the sensor

## Usage

[Provide basic usage examples]
