# edrv-mpu6050

Rust driver for MPU-6050, MPU-6000 and MPU-6500 IMU sensors.

## Overview

This project provides a Rust driver for the MPU-6050, MPU-6000 and MPU-6500 IMU sensors. It aims to offer a consistent and reliable interface for interacting with the MPU-6050 and MPU-6000 sensors in embedded Rust applications.

## Maintenance

This project is maintained by the embedded-drivers team. Our organization's goal is to provide consistent driver access interfaces for embedded Rust and to maintain these drivers collectively to avoid orphaned crates.

## Features
