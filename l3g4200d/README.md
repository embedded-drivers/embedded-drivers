# edrv-l3g4200d

Rust driver for L3G4200D.

## Overview

This project provides a Rust driver for the L3G4200D 3-axis gyroscope. It aims to offer a consistent and reliable interface for interacting with the L3G4200D sensor in embedded Rust applications.

## Maintenance

This project is maintained by the embedded-drivers team. Our organization's goal is to provide consistent driver access interfaces for embedded Rust and to maintain these drivers collectively to avoid orphaned crates.

## Features
