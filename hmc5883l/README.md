# edrv-hmc5883l

Rust driver for HMC5883L.

## Overview

This project provides a Rust driver for the HMC5883L 3-axis magnetometer. It aims to offer a consistent and reliable interface for interacting with the HMC5883L sensor in embedded Rust applications.

## Maintenance

This project is maintained by the embedded-drivers team. Our organization's goal is to provide consistent driver access interfaces for embedded Rust and to maintain these drivers collectively to avoid orphaned crates.
